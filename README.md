## Overview

This project allows to describe and automatically restore a Philips Hue Bridge configuration.

It can be used to:
* Factory-reset a Hue Bridge and restore its previous configuration
* Move a configuration to another Hue Bridge 
* Split an existing configuration across two Hue Bridges

## Input configuration file

### Schema
The configuration must adhere to [config-schema.json](./module/src/config/config-schema.json)

### Examples
* [simple-config.json](./samples/simple-config.json)
* [bridge1-config.json](./samples/bridge1-config.json)
* [bridge2-config.json](./samples/bridge2-config.json)

## Run the program

1. Run: `cd module && npm install` 
2. Reset the Hue Bridge, then press the button in the centre of the Hue Bridge
3. Run: `npm run start --config=../samples/your-config.json`

Additional options:
* `--bridge=192.168.1.25` - Will skip Hue Bridge discovery and use the provided IP address instead
* `--appkey=AXYvXm9Bf5bâ€¦PZPW40TEM` - Will use the provided authentication key instead of creating a new one

## Program steps

The program will:

1. Load and check the input configuration
2. Search for the bridge that was pressed
3. Create a bridge user and authentication key
4. Delete bridge resources (if any)
5. Add the bridge location for sunset/sunrise detection
6. Create rooms and zones
7. Search for lights (from their serial and MAC address) and add them to rooms and zones
8. Create a "Default" scene in each room and zone
9. Set a default power-on behavior for all lights
10. Search for accessories and add them to the bridge
11. Configure accessories to activate the "Default" scene of a room or a zone
